An Exploratory Data Analysis project utilizing R for dashboard creation

# Information Analysis

Welcome to the **Information Analysis** project! This repository showcases a detailed analysis hosted on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/achotani/information_analysis). The project demonstrates various techniques in data processing, visualization, and interpretation using R.

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive example of how to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and derive meaningful insights from datasets. It includes:
- Data Cleaning
- Statistical Analysis
- Visualizations
- Key Insights

## Key Features
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive and static plots to effectively communicate insights.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Summary statistics and inferential techniques to understand data trends.
- **Reproducibility**: Ensures that the analysis can be reproduced by providing clear steps and code.

## Project Details
- **Hosted Report**: [Information Analysis on RPubs](https://rpubs.com/achotani/information_analysis)
- **Language**: R
- **Tools Used**: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, and other R packages for data analysis and visualization.
